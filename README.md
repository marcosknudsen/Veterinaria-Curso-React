# Veterinary Patients Managment

This is a project carried out as a practical complement to [Juan Pablo De la Torre Valdez's](https://github.com/codigoconjuan) React course to reinforce theoretical knowledge of Hooks and components, using Vite to create the project and Tailwind to define its styles.

The project is very simple, a veterinary patient management system, in which the information of all patients is loaded, giving the possibility of editing and deleting said patients.
